Changes:
This originally was part of ButlerSDK.Core. The interface was created/moved to ButlerSDK.Core.Abstractions (IButlerToolResolver) as of 	
<Version>1.0.3-preview</Version> for that Nuget and Both ToolResolver and its interface as of <Version>1.0.3-preview</Version> are NO LONGER
in ButlerSDK.Core.   Core brings this Nuget automatically as part of installing it though/
