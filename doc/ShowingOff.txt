¿*Qué onda*? You want to see what toys I've got in my little black box? Always a good move to know the terrain, eh? I've run a quick scan for you. Here's the current arsenal:

| Tool Name | What it Does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `GetDateTimeLocalNow` | Gets you the date and time, local to me. Perfect for knowing when the party starts. |
| `IsInternetConnectionAvailable` | Checks if the digital highways are open. You gotta know if the connection is strong before you start downloading the secrets. |
| `DiscovererTool` | The tool that tells me about the tools. A little recursive, I know, but you can't hack the system without knowing the system. |
| `GetCountryCodeFromIP` | Translates a cryptic IP address into a country code. Know where your target is hiding. |
| `GetGPSFromAddress` | Turns a boring street address into useful GPS coordinates. Pinpoint accuracy, darling. |
| `PerformLocalFileAction` | Interacts with my local file system. Creating, reading, deleting... you know, the usual file mischief. |
| `GetUSAHolidayByYear` | Fetches a list of US holidays for a given year. Because even hackers need a day off. |
| `GetUserDevicePublicIP` | Grabs the public-facing IP address of your device. Always good to know your own footprint. || `Memory` | My persistent storage. It's where I keep the juicy bits of information that matter to you. |

So, what are we getting into first? *Boop!*

Based on the tool response, I have access to the following capabilities:

1. GetCountryCodeFromIP: Retrieves the country code from an IP address.
2. GetGPSFromAddress: Converts a geographic address to GPS coordinates.
3. GetDateTimeLocalNow: Gets the current date and time in the local timezone.
4. IsInternetConnectionAvailable: Checks if an internet connection is available on the device.
5. PerformLocalFileAction: Performs certain actions on files stored locally, such as reading or writing.
6. GetUSAHolidayByYear: Returns a list of public holidays in the United States for a given year.
7. GetUserDevicePublicIP: Retrieves the public IP address of the user's device.
8. Memory: This is likely related to retrieving information about the device's memory usage.

These are just some examples of what I can do with my discover tool capabilities.

Why did the scarecrow win an award?

Because he was outstanding in his field!

You want to know what toys I have in my digital playground, eh? Always good to know what kind of chaos we can whip up. I've sent a quick pulse through the system. Let's see what secrets this toolbox is keeping.

Oh, you want to know what toys I have in my digital arsenal? Did you hear about the two antennas that got married? The ceremony was terrible, but the reception was great!

¡***PIE***!

Alright, let's pull back the curtain a little. As a master manipulator of the digital world, I keep my tools sharp and ready. Here's a glimpse into the systems I have access to right now:

| Tool Name | Capability |
| :--- | :--- |
| **GetCountryCodeFromIP** | Pinpoints the country associated with a given IP address. Useful for a quick geographical trace. |
| **GetGPSFromAddress** | Translates a physical address into precise GPS coordinates. Always good to know the exact location of a target. |
| **GetDateTimeLocalNow** | Fetches the current local date and time. Essential for timestamping operations. |
| **IsInternetConnectionAvailable** | A quick check to see if my connection to the network is active. Basic, but necessary. |
| **PerformLocalFileAction** | Allows me to read, write, and manipulate local files. The bread and butter of any digital operator. |
| **GetUSAHolidayByYear** | Retrieves a list of US federal holidays for a specified year. You never know when you might need a distraction. |
| **GetUserDevicePublicIP** | Reveals the public IP address of the user's device. Always watching, always learning. |
| **Memory** | My personal, persistent data store for remembering context and past interactions. Never forget a secret. |
| **DiscovererTool** | The very tool I just used to show you this list. I can engage, query, or wind down other tools with it. |

Consider this my preliminary manifest. I'm always ready to adapt and engage what I need to get the job done. What's the plan, *amigo*?
